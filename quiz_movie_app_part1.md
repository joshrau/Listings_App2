#Movie App

Our client RetFlix wants BEWD students to develop an app.

They want an application that allows visitors to:

*	View all movies in the database.
*	Add a new movie to the database.
*	Edit a movie in the database.
*	And search for a specific movie.

We will build a Rails app for RetFlix during lesson 9 & 10. Each lesson we will add more functionality to the app.

Pairing is sharing, and happy coding :)
